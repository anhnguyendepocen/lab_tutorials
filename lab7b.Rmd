## Introduction {-}

In this second of three chapters that deal with multivariate clustering methods, we will 
cover two classic clustering methods, i.e.,  **k-means**, and **hierarchical clustering**. 

The problem addressed
by a clustering method is to group the *n* observations into *k* **clusters** such that
the intra-cluster similarity is maximized (or, dissimilarity minimized), and the 
between-cluster similarity minimized (or, dissimilarity maximized). K-means is a so-called
partitioning clustering method in which the data are *partitioned* into k groups, with
k determined beforehand. In constrast,
hierarchical clustering builds up the clusters from the bottom up (or top down) and can be considered for
many values of k.

The clustering methods
are standard tools of so-called unsupervised learning and constitute a core element in 
any machine learning toolbox. An extensive technical discussion is beyond the scope
of this document, but a thorough treatment can be found in @Hastieetal:09 and
@Jamesetal:13, among others.

GeoDa implements the cluster algorithms by leveraging the *C Clustering Library*
[@deHoonetal:17], augmented by the k-means++ algorithm from @ArthurVassilvitskii:07.

To illustrate these techniques, we will continue to use the Guerry data set on
moral statistics in 1830 France, which comes pre-installed with GeoDa.

### Getting started {-}
As before, with GeoDa launched and all previous projects closed, we again load the Guerry sample data set from the **Connect to Data Source** interface. We either load it from the sample data 
collection and then save the file in a working directory, or we use a previously saved version.  The process should yield the familiar themeless base map, showing the 85 French departments,
as in Figure \@ref(fig:guerrybase).

```{r guerrybase, out.width='80%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="French departments themeless map"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/0_547_themelessbasemap.png')
```

## K Means {-}

### Principle {-}
The k-means algorithm starts with an initial (random) partioning of the **n** data
points into **k**
groups, and then incrementally improves upon this until convergence. In a general sense,
observations are assigned to the cluster centroid to which they are closest, using
 an Euclidean (squared difference) dissimilarity 
criterion.

A key element in this method is the choice of the number of clusters, k. Typically, 
several values for k are considered, and the resulting clusters are then compared in terms of the
objective function. Since the total variance equals the sum of the within-group variances
and the total between-group variance, a common criterion is to assess the ratio of the total
between-group variance to the total variance. A higher value for this ratio suggests a better
separation of the clusters. However, since this ratio increases with k, the selection
of a *best* k is not straightforward. In practice, one can plot the ratio against values for
k and select a point where the additional improvement in the objective is no longer
meaningful. Several ad hoc rules have been suggested, but none is totally satisfactory.

The k-means algorithm does not guarantee a global optimum, but only a local one.
In addition, it is sensitive to the starting
point used to initiate the iterative procedure. In GeoDa, two different approaches are
implemented. One uses a series of random initial assignments, creating several initial clusters and starting
the iterative process with the best among these solutions. In order to ensure replicability, it
is important to set a seed value for the random number generator. Also, to assess the 
sensitivity of the result to the starting point, different seeds should be tried (as well as a
different number of initial solutions).

A second approach uses a careful consideration of initial seeds, following the procedure
outlined in @ArthurVassilvitskii:07, commonly referred to as **k-means++**. While generally being
faster and 
resulting in a superior solution in small to medium sized data sets,
this method does not scale well (as it requires
k passes through the whole data set to find the initial values). Note that a choice of a large number of random initial allocations may
yield a better outcome than the application of k-means++, at the expense of a
somewhat longer execution time.

### Implementation {-}
We invoke the k-means functionality from the **Clusters** toolbar icon,
in Figure \@ref(fig:kmeansicon).

```{r kmeansicon, out.width='15%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Clusters toolbar icon"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/1_683_cluster_toolbaricon.png')
```

We select **K Means** from the list of options. Alternatively, from the main menu,
shown in Figure \@ref(fig:kmeansmenu), we
can select **Clusters > K Means**.

```{r kmeansmenu, out.width='15%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="K Means Option"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/1_714_kmeans_option.png')
```

This brings up the **K Means Clustering Settings** dialog, shown
in Figure \@ref(fig:kmeansvars), the main interface through which variables
are chosen, options selected, and summary results are provided.

#### Variable Settings Panel {-}
We select the variables and set the parameters for the K Means cluster analysis 
through the options in the left hand panel of the interface. We choose the same six
variables as in the previous chapter: **Crm_prs**,
**Crm_prp**, **Litercy**, **Donatns**, **Infants**, and **Suicids**.
 These variables
appear highlighted in the **Select Variables** panel.

```{r kmeansvars, out.width='80%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="K Means variable selection"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/2_715_kmeans_variables.png')
```

The next option is to select the **Number of Clusters**. The initial setting is blank. One can either choose a value from
the drop-down list, or enter an integer value directly.^[The drop-down list goes from 2 to 85, 
which may be insufficient in *big data* settings. Hence GeoDa now offers the option to enter
a value directly.] In our example, we set the number of clusters to **5**.

A default option is to use the variables in standardized form, i.e., in standard
deviational units,^[The Z standardization subtracts the mean and divides by the
standard deviation. An alternative standardization is to use the mean absolute
deviation, MAD.] expressed with **Transformation** set to **Standardize (Z)**.

The default algorithm is
**KMeans++** with initialization re-runs set to 150 and maximal iterations to 1000.
The **seed** is the global random number seed set for GeoDa, which can be changed by means of the
**Use specified seed** option. Finally, the default **Distance Function** is **Euclidean**.
For k-means, this option cannot be changed, but for hierarchical clustering, there is also
a **Manhattan** distance metric.

The cluster classification will be
saved in the variable specified in the **Save Cluster in Field** box. The default of **CL**
is likely not very useful if several options will be explored. In our first example, we
set the variable name to **CLa**.

#### Cluster results {-}

After pressing **Run**, and keeping all the settings as above, a cluster map is created as a new view and the characteristics of 
the cluster are listed in the **Summary** panel.

The cluster map in Figure \@ref(fig:kmeansmap5) reveals quite evenly balanced clusters, with 22, 19, 18, 16 and 10 members
respectively. Keep in mind that the clusters are based on attribute similarity and they do not respect
contiguity or compactness (we will examine this aspect in a later chapter). 

```{r kmeansmap5, out.width='80%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="K Means cluster map (k=5)"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/2_717_clustermap_5.png')
```

The cluster characteristics are listed in the **Summary** panel, shown
in Figure \@ref(fig:kmeanssummary5). This lists, for each cluster, the
method (KMeans), the value of k (here, 5), as well as
the parameters specified (i.e., the initialization methods, number of initialization
re-runs, the maximum iterations, transformation, and  distance function). Next
follows the values of the cluster centers for each of the variables involved in the
clustering algorithm (with the **Standardize** option on, these variables have been transformed to have zero mean and variance one overall, but not in each of the clusters).

In addition, some summary measures are provided to assess the extent to which the clusters
achieve within-cluster similarity and between-cluster dissimilarity. The total sum of
squares is listed, as well as the within-cluster sum of squares for each of the clusters.
Finally, these statistics are summarized as the total within-cluster sum of squares,
the total between-cluster sum of squares, and the ratio of between-cluster to total 
sum of squares. In our initial example, the latter is 0.497467.

```{r kmeanssummary5, out.width='80%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="K Means cluster characteristics (k=5)"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/2_716_cluster_chars_5.png')
```

The cluster labels (and colors in the map) are arbitrary and can be changed in the cluster
map, using the same technique we saw earlier for unique value maps (in fact, the cluster
maps are a special case of unique value maps). For example, if we wanted to switch 
category 4 with 3 and the corresponding colors, we would move the light green rectangle
in the legend with label 4 up to the third spot in the legend, as shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:changelabels).

```{r changelabels, out.width='25%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Change cluster labels"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/2_722_change_labels1.png')
```

Once we release the cursor, an updated cluster map is produced, with the categories (and colors)
for 3 and 4 switched, as in Figure \@ref(fig:kmeanschangelabels).

```{r kmeanschangelabels, out.width='80%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Relabeled cluster map"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/2_723_changed_labels.png')
```

As the clusters are computed, a new categorical variable is added to the data table
(the variable name is specified in the **Save Cluster in Field** option).
It contains the assignment of each observation to one of the clusters as an 
integer variable. However, this
is not automatically updated when we change the labels, as we did in the example above.

In order to save the updated classification, we can still use the generic **Save Categories** option 
available in any map view (right click in the map).
After specifying a variable name (e.g., **cat_a**), we can see both the original categorical
variable and the new classification in the data table. 

In the table, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:kmeanscattable), wherever **CLa** (the original
classification) is **3**, the new classification (**cat_a**) is **4**.
As always, the new variables do not become permanent additions until the table is saved.


```{r kmeanscattable, out.width='25%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Cluster categories in table"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/2_725_labels.png')
```

#### Saving the cluster results {-}
The summary results listed in the **Summary** panel can be saved to a text file. Right clicking
on the panel to brings up a dialog with a **Save** option,
as in Figure \@ref(fig:kmeanssave). Selecting this and specifying a file name
for the results will provide a permanent record of the analysis.

```{r kmeanssave, out.width='60%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Saving summary results to a text file"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/2_731_savesummary.png')
```

### Options and sensitivity analysis {-}
The k-means algorithm depends crucially on its initialization. In GeoDa, there are
two methods to approach this. The default
k-means++ algorithm usually picks a very good starting point. However, the number
of initial runs may need to be increased to obtain the best solution.

The second method is so-called random initialization. In this approach, k observations are
randomly picked and used as seeds for an initial cluster assignment, for which the summary
characteristics are then computed. This is repeated many times and the best solution is used
as the starting point for the actual k-means algorithm.

It is important to assess the sensitivity of the results to the starting point, and
several combinations of settings should be compared.

In addition to the starting options, it is also possible to *constrain* the k-means
clustering by imposing a minimum value for a spatially extensive variable, such as a
total population. This ensures that the clusters meet a minimum size for that variable.
For example, we may want to create neighborhood types (clusters) based on a number
of census variables, but we also want to make sure that each type has a  minimum
overall population size, to avoid creating clusters that are *too small* in terms
of population. We will encounter this approach again when we discuss the max-p
method for spatially constrained clustering.

#### Changing the number of initial runs in k-means++ {-}
The default number of initial re-runs for the k-means++ algorithm is **150**. Sometimes,
this is not sufficient to guarantee the best possible result (in terms of the ratio of between
to total sum of squares). We can change this value in the **Initialization Re-runs** dialog, as
illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:kppinit) for a value of **1000** iterations.


```{r kppinit, out.width='40%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="K-means++ initialization re-runs"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/4_042_kppinitialize1000.png')
```

The result is slightly different from what we obtained for the default setting.
As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:kppinitmap), the first category now has 23 elements, and
the second 18. The other groupings remain the same.


```{r kppinitmap, out.width='80%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Cluster map for 1000 initial re-runs"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/4_043_kpp1000map.png')
```

The revised initialization results in a slight improvement of the sum of squares ratio, 
changing from 0.497467 to 0.497772, as shown in
Figure \@ref(fig:kppinitresults).

```{r kppinitresults, out.width='80%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Cluster characteristics for 1000 initial reruns"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/4_044_kppinitresults.png')
```


#### Random initialization {-}
The alternative to the KMeans++ initialization is to select **Random** as the **Initialization Method**,
as shown in Figure  \@ref(fig:randominit). We keep the number of initialization re-runs
to the default value of 150 and save the result in the
variable **CLr**.


```{r randominit, out.width='40%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Random initialization"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/3_732_randominit.png')
```

The result is identical to what we obtained for K-means++ with 1000 initialization re-runs,
with the cluster map as in  Figure \@ref(fig:kppinitmap) and the cluster summary
as in Figure \@ref(fig:kppinitresults). However, if we had run the random initialization with
much fewer runs (e.g., 10), the results would be inferior to what we obtained before.
This highlights the effect of the starting values on the ultimate result.

#### Setting a minimum bound {-}
The minimum bound is set in the variable settings dialog by checking the
box next to **Minimum Bound**, as in Figure \@ref(fig:minbound). In our example, we
select the variable **Pop1831** to set the constraint. Note that we specify a bound
of **15%** (or **4855**) rather than the default **10%**. This is because the 
standard k-means solution satisfies the default constraint already, so that no actual bounding
is carried out.

```{r minbound, out.width='40%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Setting a minimum bound"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/7_075_minbound.png')
```

With the cluster size at 5 and all other options at their default value, we obtain
the cluster result shown in the map in Figure \@ref(fig:minboundmap). These results
differ slightly from the unconstrained map in Figure \@ref(fig:kmeansmap5).

```{r minboundmap, out.width='80%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Cluster map with minimum bound constraint"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/7_076_minboundmap.png')
```

The cluster characteristics show a slight deterioriation of our summary criterion,
to a value of **0.484033** (compared to **0.497772**), as shown in 
Figure \@ref(fig:minboundresults). This is the price to pay to
satisfy the minimum population constraint.

```{r minboundresults, out.width='80%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Cluster characteristics with minimum bound"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/7_077_minboundsummary.png')
```


#### Aggregation by cluster {-}
With the clusters at hand, as defined for each observation by the category in the cluster
field, we can now compute aggregate values for the new clusters. We illustrate this
as a quick check on the population totals we imposed in the bounded cluster procedure.

The aggregation is invoked from the **Table** as an option by right-clicking. This
brings up the list of options, from which we select **Aggregate**, as in 
Figure \@ref(fig:tabagg).

```{r tabagg, out.width='20%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Table Aggregate option"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/7_002_table_aggregate.png')
```

The following dialog, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:tabaggpop), provides the specific
aggregation method, i.e., count, average, max, min, or **Sum**, the **key** on which
to aggregate and a selection of variable to aggregate. In our example, we use the
cluster field key, e.g., **CLb** and select only the population variable **Pop1831**,
which we will sum over the departments that make up each cluster. This can be readily
extended to multiple variables, as well as to different summary measures, such
as the average.^[In the current implementation, the same summary method needs to 
be applied to all the variables.]

```{r tabaggpop, out.width='40%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Aggregation of total population by cluster"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/7_079_aggregate_vars.png')
```

Pressing the **Aggregate** key brings up a dialog to select the file in which the new
results will be saved. For example, we can select a **dbf** format and specify the
file name. The contents of the new file are given in Figure \@ref(fig:clusterpop),
with the total population for each cluster. Clearly, each cluster meets the minimum
requirement of 4855 that was specified.

```{r clusterpop, out.width='40%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Total population by cluster"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/7_084_minbound_agg.png')
```

The same procedure can be used to create new values for any variable, aggregated
to the new cluster scale.

## Hierarchical Clustering {-}

### Principle {-}
In contrast to a partioning method (like k-means), a hierarchical clustering approach 
builds the clusters step by step. This can be approached in a top-down fashion or in
a bottom-up fashion. 

In a top-down approach, we start with the full data set as one cluster,
and find the best break point to create two clusters. This process continues until each
observation is its own cluster. The result of the successive divisions of the data is
visualized in a so-called *dendrogram*, i.e., a representation as a tree.

The bottom-up approach starts with each observation being assigned to its own cluster.
Next, the two observations are found that are *closest* (using a given distance criterion),
and they are combined into a cluster. This process repeats itself, by using a *representative
point* for each grouping once multiple observations are combined. At the end of this process,
there is a single cluster, containing all the observations. Again, the results of the
sequential grouping of observations (and clusters) are visually represented by a dendrogram.

The dendrogram is used to set a *cut* level for a specified k. By placing the cut point
at different levels in the tree, clusters with varying dimensions are obtained.

A key aspect of the hierarchical clustering process is how to compute the *distance* between
two existing clusters in order to decide how to group the *closest* two together. There are
several criteria in use, such as single linkage, complete linkage, average linkage, and
Ward's method (or centroid linkage).

With *single linkage*, the distance between two clusters is defined by the distance between
the *closest* (in attribute space) observations from each cluster. In contrast, for *complete linkage*, the distance
is between the observations that are furthest apart. *Average linkage* uses the average of all the
pairwise distances, whereas *Ward's method* utilizes the distance between a central point in
each cluster.

A common default is to use Ward's method, which tend to result in nicely balanced clusters.
The complete linkage method yields similar clusters. In contrast, single linkage and average
linkage tends to result in many singletons and a few very large clusters.

### Implementation {-}
Hierarchical clustering is invoked in GeoDa from the same toolbar icon as k-means, shown
in Figure \@ref(fig:kmeansicon), by selecting the proper item from the drop down list. The desired clustering functionality can also be selected by using **Clusters > Hierarchical** from the
menu, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:hierarchicalmenu).

```{r hierarchicalmenu, out.width='15%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Hierarchical clustering option"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/4_035_hierarchical.png')
```

#### Variable Settings Panel {-}
As before, the variables to be clustered are selected in the **Variables Settings** panel. We
continue with the same six variables, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:hiervars).

```{r hiervars, out.width='40%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Hierarchical clustering variable selection"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/5_048_hiervars.png')
```

The panel also allows one to set several options, such as the **Transformation** (default value
is a standardized z-value), the linkage **Method** (default is Ward's method), and the
**Distance Function** (default is Euclidean). In the same way as for k-means, the cluster
classification is saved in the data table under the variable name specified in
**Save Cluster in Field**.

### Cluster results {-}
The actual computation of the clusters proceeds in two steps. In the first step, 
after clicking on **Run**, a dendrogram is presented. The default cut point is set to 5,
but this can be changed interactively (see below). Once a cut point is selected, clicking on
**Save/Show Map** creates the cluster map, computes the summary characteristics, and saves the
cluster classification in the data table.

#### Dendrogram {-}
With all options set to the default, the resulting dendrogram is as in Figure \@ref(fig:dendrogram5).
The dashed red line corresponds to a cut point that yields five clusters (the default). The
dendrogram shows how individual observations are combined into groups of two, and subsequently
into larger and larger groups, by combining pairs of clusters. The colors on the right hand
side match the colors of the observations in the cluster map (see next).

```{r dendrogram5, out.width='60%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Dendrogram (k=5)"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/5_049_dendrogram5.png')
```

The dashed line (cut point) can be moved interactively. For example, in Figure \@ref(fig:dendrogram8),
we *grabbed* the line at the top (it can equally be grabbed at the bottom), and moved
it to the right to yield eight clusters. The corresponding colors are shown on the
right hand bar.

```{r dendrogram8, out.width='60%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Dendrogram (k=8)"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/5_050_dendrogram8.png')
```

#### Cluster map {-}
As mentioned before, once the dendrogram cut point is specified, clicking on **Save/Show Map**
will generate the cluster map, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:hiermapW5). Note how the colors for
the map categories match the colors in the dendrogram. Also, the number of observations
in each class also are the same between the groupings in the dendrogram and the cluster map.

```{r hiermapW5, out.width='80%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Hierarchical cluster map (Ward, k=5)"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/5_051_hierclusmapW5.png')
```

#### Cluster summary {-}
Similarly, once **Save/Show Map** has been selected, the cluster descriptive statistics
become available from the **Summary** button in the dialog. The same characteristics are reported
as for k-means. In comparison to our k-means solution, this set of clusters is slightly 
inferior in terms of the ratio of between to total sum of squares, achieving 0.482044. However,
setting the number of clusters at five is by no means necessarily the best solution. In a 
real application, one would experiment with different cut points and evaluate the solutions
relative to the k-means solution. 

```{r, out.width='80%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Hierarchical cluster characteristics (Ward, k=5"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/5_052_hierW5summary.png')
```

The two k-means and hierarchical clustering approaches can also be used in conjunction with each other. For example, one could
explore the dendrogram to find a good cut-point, and then use this value for k in a k-means
or other partitioning method.

### Options and sensitivity analysis {-}
The main option of interest in hierarchical clustering is the linkage **Method**. In
addition, we can alter the **Distance Function** and the **Transformation**.  The
latter operates in the
same fashion as for k-means.

So far, we have used the default setting for **Ward's-linkage**. We now consider each of the other linkage options in turn and illustrate the associated dendrogram, cluster map and cluster
characteristics.

#### Single linkage {-}
The linkage options are chosen from the **Method** item in the dialog. For example, 
in Figure \@ref(fig:singlelinkagemethod), we select **Single-linkage**. The other
options are chosen in the same way.

```{r singlelinkagemethod, out.width='40%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Single linkage"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/5_053_single_linkage.png')
```

The cluster results for single linkage are typically characterized by one or a few very
large clusters and several singletons (one observation per cluster). In our example,
this is illustrated by the dendrogram in Figure \@ref(fig:dendrosingle5), and the
corresponding cluster map in Figure \@ref(fig:single5map). Four *clusters* consist of a
single observation, with the main cluster collecting the 81 other observations. This
situation is not remedied by moving the cut point such that more clusters result, since
almost all of the additional clusters are singletons as well.

```{r dendrosingle5, out.width='60%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Dendrogram single linkage (k=5)"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/5_054_dendrogram_single.png')
```

```{r single5map, out.width='80%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Hierarchical cluster map (single linkage, k=5)"}

The characteristics of the single linkage hierarchical cluster are similarly dismal. Since
four *clusters* are singeltons, their within cluster sum of squares is **0**. Hence,
the total within-cluster sum of squares equals the sum of squares for cluster 5.
The resulting ratio of between to total sum of squares is only 0.214771.

```

In practice, in most situations, single linkage will not be a good choice, unless the
objective is to identify a lot of singletons.

#### Complete linkage {-}
The complete linkage method yields clusters that are similar in balance to Ward's method.
For example, in Figure \@ref(fig:dendrocomplete5), the dendrogram is shown for our example,
using a cut point with five clusters. The corresponding cluster map is given as
Figure \@ref(fig:completemap). The map is similar in structure to that obtained with Ward's
method (Figure \@ref(fig:hiermapW5)), but note that the largest category (at 39) is much larger
than the largest for Ward (25).

```{r dendrocomplete5, out.width='60%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Dendrogram complete linkage (k=5)"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/5_057_dendro_complete5.png')
```


```{r completemap, out.width='80%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Hierarchical cluster map (complete linkage, k=5)"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/5_058_complete_map.png')
```

In terms of the cluster characteristics, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:completesummary), we note
a slight deterioration relative to Ward's results, with the ratio of between to total sum
of squares at 0.423101 (but much better than single linkage).

```{r completesummary, out.width='80%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Hierarchical cluster characteristics (complete linkage, k=5)"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/5_059_complete_summary.png')
```


#### Average linkage {-}
Finally, the average linkage criterion suffers from some of the same problems as single
linkage, although it yields slightly better results. The dendrogram and cluster map
are shown in Figures \@ref(fig:dendroavg5) and \@ref(fig:avgmap).


```{r dendroavg5, out.width='60%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Dendrogram average linkage (k=5)"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/5_060_dendro_average.png')
```

```{r avgmap, out.width='80%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Hierarchical cluster map (average linkage, k=5)"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/5_061_average_map.png')
```

As given in Figure \@ref(fig:avgsummary), the summary characteristics are slighly better
than in the single linkage case, with only two singletons. However, the overall ratio of
between to total sum of squares is still much worse than for the other two methods,
at 0.296838.

```{r avgsummary, out.width='80%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Hierarchical cluster characteristics (average linkage, k=5)"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/5_062_average_summary.png')
```

#### Distance metric {-}
The default metric to gauge the distance between the center of each cluster is the
Euclidean distance. In some contexts, it may be preferable to use absolute or Manhattan
block distance, which penalizes larger distances less. This option can be selected
through the **Distance Function** item in the dialog, as in Figure  \@ref(fig:kmeansdist).

```{r kmeansdist, out.width='40%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Manhattan distance metric"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/6_065_hier_manhattan.png')
```

We run this for the same variables using  Ward's linkage and a cut point yielding 5 clusters.
The corresponding cluster map is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:mandistmap), with the summary
characteristics given in Figure \@ref(fig:mandistsummary).

```{r mandistmap, out.width='80%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Manhattan distance cluster map"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/6_066_h_man_map.png')
```

```{r mandistsummary, out.width='80%',fig.align="center",fig.cap="Manhattan distance cluster characteristics"}
knitr::include_graphics('./pics7b/6_067_h_man_summary.png')
```

Relative to the Euclidean distance results, the ratio of between to total sum of squares
is somewhat worse, at 0.44549 (compared to 0.482044). However, this is not a totally fair comparison, since the
criterion for grouping is not based on a variance measure, but on an absolute difference.
